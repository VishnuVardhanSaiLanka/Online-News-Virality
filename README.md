# Online-News-Virality

Using the data sheet present in UCI repository for Online News Popularity we are going to design a model that will predict if a news article is going to be viral or not

In the datasheet the target variable is the number of shares of an article. To make this a classification problem, I took the median of all shares as a threshold and converted the target variable into binary form.

Various Machine Learning Models are deployed and finally the best one is picked.
